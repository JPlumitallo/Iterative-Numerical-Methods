# Iterative-Numerical-Methods

In this repository are a selection of iterative numerical methods to solve for the roots of functions (in this case prefabricated) of any form. The root-finding algorithms presented here include Newton's method, the bisection method, the Jacobi method, and the secant method. One will note that these methods are implemented to compute results with precision such that the error is negligible.

Differentiation is also presented in the Newton's method program, as it is necessary to compute Newton's method.

In some of these files there are efficiency and time tests between aforementioned methods.
